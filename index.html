      <h2>Features</h2>

      <h3>High performance</h3>
      Fortran has been designed from the ground-up for computationally 
      intensive applications in science and engineering.
      Mature and battle-tested compilers and libraries allow you to write
      code that runs close to the metal, fast.

      <h3>Statically and strongly typed</h3>
      Fortran is statically and strongly typed, which allows the 
      compiler to catch many programming errors early on for you.
      This also allows the compiler to generate efficient binary code.

      <h3>Easy to learn and use</h3>
      Fortran is a relatively small language that is surprisingly easy 
      to learn and use.
      Expressing most mathematical and arithmetic operations over large 
      arrays is as simple as you'd write them as equations on a whiteboard.

      <h3>Versatile</h3>
      Fortran allows you to write code in a style that best fits your problem:
      Imperative, procedural, array-oriented, object-oriented, or functional.

      <h3>Natively parallel</h3>
      Fortran is a natively parallel programming language
      with intuitive array-like syntax to communicate data between CPUs.
      You can run almost the same code on a single CPU, 
      on a shared-memory multicore system, or on a distributed-memory 
      HPC or cloud-based system.
      Coarrays, teams, events, and collective subroutines
      allow you to express different parallel programming patterns
      that best fit your problem at hand.

      <h2 id="faqs">FAQ</h2>

      <dl class="faqs">
        <h3>What is the status of Fortran?</h3>
        Fortran is still in active development. 
	The latest revision of the language is <a href="https://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink?func=ll&objId=19441669&objAction=Open">Fortran 2018</a>,
	and the next one, with the working title Fortran 202x,
	is planned for release in the next few years.
	Further, open source projects like the
	<a href="https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib">Standard Library</a>
	and the
	<a href="https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm">Fortran Package Manager</a>
        are in active development.

        <h3>What is Fortran used for?</h3>
	Fortran is mostly used in domains that adopted computation
	early--science and engineering. 
        These include numerical weather and ocean prediction, 
	computational fluid dynamics, applied math, statistics, and finance.
	Fortran is the dominant language of High Performance Computing,
	and is used to 
	<a href="https://top500.org">benchmark the fastest supercomputers in the world</a>.

        <h3>Should I use Fortran for my new project?</h3>
	If you're writing a program or a library to perform fast arithmetic
	computation over large numeric arrays, Fortran is the optimal tool 
	for the job.
