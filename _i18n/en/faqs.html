<h3>What is the status of Fortran?</h3>
Fortran is still in active development. 
The latest revision of the language is <a href="https://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink?func=ll&objId=19441669&objAction=Open">Fortran 2018</a>,
and the next one, with the working title Fortran 202x,
is planned for release in the next few years.
Further, open source projects like the
<a href="https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib">Standard Library</a>
and the
<a href="https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm">Fortran Package Manager</a>
are in active development.

<h3>What is Fortran used for?</h3>
Fortran is mostly used in domains that adopted computation
early--science and engineering. 
These include numerical weather and ocean prediction, 
computational fluid dynamics, applied math, statistics, and finance.
Fortran is the dominant language of High Performance Computing,
and is used to 
<a href="https://top500.org">benchmark the fastest supercomputers in the world</a>.

<h3>Should I use Fortran for my new project?</h3>
If you're writing a program or a library to perform fast arithmetic
computation over large numeric arrays, Fortran is the optimal tool 
for the job.
