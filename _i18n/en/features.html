<h2>Features</h2>

<h3>High performance</h3>
Fortran has been designed from the ground-up for computationally 
intensive applications in science and engineering.
Mature and battle-tested compilers and libraries allow you to write
code that runs close to the metal, fast.

<h3>Statically and strongly typed</h3>
Fortran is statically and strongly typed, which allows the 
compiler to catch many programming errors early on for you.
This also allows the compiler to generate efficient binary code.

<h3>Easy to learn and use</h3>
Fortran is a relatively small language that is surprisingly easy 
to learn and use.
Expressing most mathematical and arithmetic operations over large 
arrays is as simple as you'd write them as equations on a whiteboard.

<h3>Versatile</h3>
Fortran allows you to write code in a style that best fits your problem:
Imperative, procedural, array-oriented, object-oriented, or functional.

<h3>Natively parallel</h3>
Fortran is a natively parallel programming language
with intuitive array-like syntax to communicate data between CPUs.
You can run almost the same code on a single CPU, 
on a shared-memory multicore system, or on a distributed-memory 
HPC or cloud-based system.
Coarrays, teams, events, and collective subroutines
allow you to express different parallel programming patterns
that best fit your problem at hand.
