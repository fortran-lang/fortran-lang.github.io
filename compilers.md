Fortran has several open source and commercial compilers.

## Open source compilers

### GNU Fortran Compiler

[GNU Fortran Compiler (gfortran)](https://gcc.gnu.org/fortran/) is a mature
free and open source compiler, part of the GNU Compiler Collection.

[OpenCoarrays](http://www.opencoarrays.org/) is a library and compiler wrapper
around gfortran which enables the parallel programming features of Fortran 2018
with gfortran.

### LFortran

[LFortran](https://lfortran.org) is a modern, interactive, LLVM-based Fortran
compiler.

### Flang

[Flang](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/tree/master/flang/#flang) is an
open source compiler and part of the LLVM project (formerly
called [f18](https://github.com/flang-compiler/f18)).

[Legacy Flang](https://github.com/flang-compiler/flang) is an open source
compiler that targets LLVM, originally based on the PGI compiler frontend.

## Commercial compilers

### Intel

[Intel Parallel Studio XE](https://software.intel.com/en-us/parallel-studio-xe)
is Intel's suite of compilers, tools, and libraries for Fortran, C, C++, and 
Python. 
Intel offers the Linux edition of their compiler suite for free for
[open source contributors](https://software.intel.com/en-us/parallel-studio-xe/choose-download/open-source-contributor).

### IBM

[IBM XL Fortran Compiler](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/xl-fortran-linux-compiler-power) is available for Linux on POWER9 architectures.

### NAG

The [NAG Fortran compiler](https://www.nag.com/nag-compiler) implements 
a significant part of Fortran 2018 and most of Fortran 2008.
